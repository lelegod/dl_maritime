# Ship Trajectory Prediction with Deep Learning

This is the repository for DTU Deep Learning course final project of **Group 114**.

## Quick Start

The main notebook that contains all the code and information for the report is **`for_report.ipynb`**.

To explore the project:

1. Open `for_report.ipynb`
2. Run all cells **except** the training cell (marked with `# Training loop` at the top)
3. The pre-trained model will be loaded from the `models/` folder
